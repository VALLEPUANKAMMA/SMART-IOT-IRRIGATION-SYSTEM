# SMART-IOT-IRRIGATION-SYSTEM

## Project Overview
The **Smart IoT Irrigation System** is an embedded IoT-based automation project designed to monitor environmental conditions and control irrigation automatically. The system reads **temperature**, **humidity**, and **soil moisture** values, displays them locally on an LCD, and uploads the data to the **ThingSpeak cloud platform** for remote monitoring. Based on the soil moisture level, the system automatically controls a water pump (represented by an LED for testing).

This project helps automate agricultural irrigation, reduce water wastage, and improve farming efficiency.

## Aim of the Project
The main aim of this project is to monitor the irrigation system over IoT by reading environmental parameters such as:

- Temperature
- Relative Humidity
- Soil Moisture


The collected data is sent to **ThingSpeak Cloud**, and the irrigation motor is automatically controlled based on **soil moisture conditions and user-defined irrigation settings**.

## Working Principle

The Smart IoT Irrigation System continuously monitors environmental conditions and automatically controls irrigation based on sensor data and user-defined settings.

### Step 1: System Initialization
When the system is powered ON, the LPC2148 microcontroller initializes all required peripherals:

- LCD display
- DHT11 (temperature and humidity sensor)
- Soil moisture sensor
- ESP01 Wi-Fi module
- RTC (Real Time Clock)
- Keypad
- External interrupt
- UART communication

---

### Step 2: Sensor Monitoring
The system continuously reads:

- **Temperature** from DHT11
- **Relative Humidity** from DHT11
- **Soil Moisture Level** from soil moisture sensor

The measured values are displayed on the LCD in real time.

---

### Step 3: Interrupt-Based User Configuration through Menu-Driven Interface
Whenever the user presses the **external interrupt switch**, the system enters **menu configuration mode**.

A menu is displayed on the LCD, and the user can select options using the **keypad**.

#### Menu Option 1:  Motor Timing Selection
The user can manually set the irrigation motor ON duration based on field requirements.

Example:
- 1 minute
- 2 minutes
- 3 minutes

This allows different crops or fields to receive different amounts of water.

---

#### Menu Option 2:  Temperature and Humidity Threshold Settings
The user can configure automatic motor timing based on environmental conditions.

Examples:

- **High Temperature + Low Humidity → Motor ON for 3 minutes**
- **Moderate Temperature + Moderate Humidity → Motor ON for 2 minutes**
- **Low Temperature + High Humidity → Motor ON for 1 minute**


These settings allow different crops or fields to receive different amounts of water based on user requirements.

---

### Step 4: Automatic Irrigation Control
The **soil moisture sensor** acts as the primary decision parameter.

- If the soil moisture is **low (dry soil)**, the system checks the **user-selected irrigation settings**.
- Based on the selected **motor timing** or **temperature-humidity mode**, the motor is turned **ON**.
- The motor runs for the configured duration.
- If the soil becomes **wet (sufficient moisture)**, the motor is turned **OFF**.

This ensures irrigation occurs according to the **user’s field requirements**.
---

### Step 5: UART Communication with ESP01 using Interrupts

The system uses the **UART protocol** for communication between the **LPC2148 microcontroller** and the **ESP01 Wi-Fi module**.

#### UART Transmission
The LPC2148 sends **AT commands** to the ESP01 through the **UART transmitter** to configure the Wi-Fi module and establish communication with the ThingSpeak cloud.

Examples of transmitted AT commands:

- `AT` → Check ESP01 response
- `AT+CWMODE` → Set Wi-Fi mode
- `AT+CWJAP` → Connect to Wi-Fi network
- `AT+CIPSTART` → Open TCP connection
- `AT+CIPSEND` → Send data
- HTTP request to update ThingSpeak fields

---

#### UART Reception using Interrupts
The ESP01 sends back response messages such as:

- `OK`
- `ERROR`
- `SEND OK`
- Wi-Fi connection status

These responses are received using the **UART receiver interrupt**.

Whenever data is received from the ESP01:

- UART receive interrupt is triggered.
- The received characters are stored in a buffer.
- The response is processed by the microcontroller.
- Important status messages are displayed on the **LCD** for user monitoring.

---

#### Benefits of UART Interrupt Communication

- Efficient real-time communication
- No continuous polling required
- Faster response handling
- Reliable transmission and reception
- Easy debugging through LCD display

---

### Step 6: Cloud Data Upload to ThingSpeak

After successful UART communication with ESP01, the system uploads the following data to **ThingSpeak Cloud**:

- Temperature
- Humidity
- Motor ON/OFF status

This allows remote monitoring of the irrigation system over the internet.
